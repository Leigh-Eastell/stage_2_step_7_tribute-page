      The unmistakeable melodic guitar intro of The Pretender began to a roaring crowd of a filled Wembley Stadium in 2008, followed by the opening lyrics sung in chorus by Dave Grohl, then the thunderous beating heart of the band’s drums came alive, being struck and stomped by the late great Taylor Hawkins. This was my introduction to seeing my favourite band live and I still get the same excitement and chills when I watch it back as I did the first time I lived it.</p>

Taylor was born Oliver Taylor Hawkins in Fort Worth, Texas on February 17, 1972. His family moved to Laguna Beach, California, in 1976, and this is where Taylor grew up. A huge Rock N Roll fan his mother took him to see Queen play at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in 1982. At Just 10 years old he turned to her and stated that “I’ll play that stadium on day.” On September 19, 1997, he achieved his ambition playing with the Foo Fighters.</p>

In his earlier days Taylor played with an Orange County based band called Sylvia then became the drummer for Sass Jordan. He then went on to play drums for Alanis Morissette from June 1995 until March 1997. During a phone call with Foo Fighters’ frontman Dave Grohl, Taylor put himself forward to be their new drummer explaining he wanted to be in a rock band. Foo Fighters announced Taylor would be the new drummer on March 18, 1997.

      Over the following years Hawkins toured the world selling out shows, releasing multiple studio albums with the Foo Fighters. Even getting to collaborate with his peers and some of his own idols. He wasn’t only a legendary drummer, he also provided vocals, guitar and piano to various recordings. If you haven’t seen him in action I urge you to check out YouTube he was a fantastic performer. In 2014 Sir Paul McCartney inducted Foo Fighters into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Sadly on their most recent tour of South America Taylor passed away at the age of 50 in Columbia on March 25, 2022. No cause of death was given. However the days to come would reveal he had various substances in his system at his time of passing. Taylor leaves behind his wife Alison whom he married in 2005, together they had three children. Dave Grohl (lead singer of the Foo Fighters) described Taylor as “my brother from another mother, my best friend, a man for whom I would take a bullet.”

Since his passing there has been an outpouring of love and appreciation for Taylor and his family he leaves behind. But the thing with musicians is, they’re never truly gone. He has left a legacy behind for the world to appreciate for the rest of time.
